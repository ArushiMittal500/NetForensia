Snort is a Network intrusion detection and Prevention tool and  Wireshark a widely known  network protocol analyzer, which is used to capture traffic destined specifically for the host, and then use snort to analyze the packet trace.
We developed a Snort tool that allows us to learn rules by capturing intrusions in live network traffic. 
The goal of the project is to figure out the various features of Snort rules and use those features to capture the live intrusion traffic. 
We combined the traffic captures to replay the traffic to a Local Area Network.  
 
In this process, the final analyzed tableau report of the captured live data packets is generated. Snort will take live data packets from the internet.
This tool will match the captured packets with predefined signatures and send  alert messages to the user if matches didnâ€™t found. In the procedure, 
in order to access the internet, WIFI is used for precise flow of data packets. 
After the capturing process, this tool generates a log file in its directory that stores each and every captured packet. 
This log file entails data packets along with their alert messages. 
The log file generated by SNORT tool is then exported to Wireshark to examine the captured network packets. 
 
Wireshark tool creates each detail about the packets of the recorded log file.
